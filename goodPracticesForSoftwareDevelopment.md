# Question 1

Which point(s) were new to you?

**Answer**-

- These were new points to me :
    - There are different tools like Trello, Jira to make documentation
    - Keeping the video on in a meeting improves the rapport with the team
    - There is something called Github gists to share the code snippets
    - Tools like Freedom, and Timelimit could help us in managing social media apps during work hours


# Question 2

Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

**Answer**-

I think that I need to improve in the area of writing things down during the meeting as documentation helps a lot in understanding the actual requirement and getting feedback to confirm if a person is on the same page with the team.

- My ideas to make progress are as follows:
    - Purchase a small diary and carry it along
    - Always share my notes with colleagues so that they can reflect on my understanding
    - If someday I forget my diary then I should have apps like Trello/Jira already installed in my system
