<hr>

###Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
**Answer-**  The most interesting idea for me to form a tiny habit is about celebrating small victories as building on smaller successes can lead to a larger one

###Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P ?
**Answer-** We can form new habits if we can make tiny changes first to incapsulate major change easily and also make our trigger to keep motivation up to follow some behavior. M stands for motivation, A for ability, and P for prompt

###Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
**Answer-** In simple words, this is called rewarding yourself first so that you start enjoying your achievements and building them progressively. We should not depend upon others' validation to celebrate our success otherwise we might get disappointed and demotivated.

###Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
**Answer-** The most interesting idea of this story is realizing that we think what we lack is motivation when it is clarity of thoughts.

###Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?
**Answer-** It says that instead of emphasizing changing behavior directly, we should emphasize changing our perception of our own identity which helps in following good habits.

###Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.
**Answer-** 
- According to the book to make a habit easier :
    - Break down the process
    - Make it easier to follow 
    - Build the trigger to start following it inadvertently
    - Focus on changing your perception of identity


###Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
**Answer-** 
- We have to increase the number of steps between us and our bad habits. To add that friction we should understand the following :
    - Delayed gratification is the actual reward
    - Triggers associated with bad habits have to be removed
    - Make bad things more difficult to perform by adding some barriers intentionally
    - Make your environment better

###Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
**Answer-** I would like to add a habit of reading documentation more often rather than just searching for videos on the internet.
- These are the following steps, I will take to make it cue obvious or easy :
    - Focus on the bigger picture and bigger rewards as I will be getting more intensive and valid information from documentation
    - Having the patience to stick to something that doesn't feel comfortable at first.
    - Start with a small step rather than taking a large action to bring changes.
    - To not get distracted, I will make sure to switch off my mobile whenever I am in focus mode.

###Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
**Answer-** I want to get rid of *binge watching* habit on my weekends. 
- I am thinking of the following steps to make it possible:
    - Change my perception of identity that 'I am a person who doesn't waste hours watching movies'
    - Finding another interesting but healthy free time activity like tracking, gyming, etc
    - To not discuss topics of movies or series with my friends
